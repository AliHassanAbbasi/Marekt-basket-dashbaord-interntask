## Project Overview
This Retail Market Basket Analysis Dashboard is developed in Power BI to provide a holistic view of retail performance through customer segmentation, product-level revenue analysis, and quarter-over-quarter growth. It enables stakeholders to understand buyer behavior and optimize sales strategy. The dashboard includes dynamic slicers for year, month, and country filters to allow real-time data exploration.

### Key Metrics:
- Quantity Sold: 50K
- Revenue: $5.34M
- Total Orders: 17K
- Average Order Value: 316

## Key Insights
1. **Customer Segmentation Impact:**
   - Loyal customers generated the highest revenue ($3.29M – 61.66%) followed by VIPs ($1.21M – 22.72%).
   - New and occasional buyers contributed less but still represent potential growth areas.

2. **Category-wise Revenue Distribution:**
   - Beauty and Clothing categories lead in total revenue, while Shoes and Accessories are slightly behind.
   - Loyal and new customers contribute significantly across all categories.

3. **Product Performance:**
   - Top-selling products include Sandals ($333K), Formal Shoes ($329K), and Boots ($321K).
   - Body care and apparel products also maintain strong sales figures.

4. **Growth Analysis (GoG %):**
   - Q2 2024 saw the highest growth (5.2%), while Q3 experienced a decline (-7.4%).
   - Growth rebounded to 3.9% in Q4, indicating seasonal demand fluctuation.

## Problems and Solutions
**Problem:** Sharp decline in growth during Q3.
**Solution:**
- Perform root cause analysis (seasonality, stock issues, or campaign gaps).
- Strengthen promotions and inventory planning for Q3.

**Problem:** Lower revenue from new and occasional customers.
**Solution:**
- Introduce loyalty programs and personalized marketing campaigns to increase repeat purchases.

## Recommendations
1. Increase focus on retaining loyal and VIP segments with exclusive deals.
2. Explore bundling strategies in underperforming product segments.
3. Monitor Q3 trends early in the cycle and build a proactive sales campaign to mitigate dips.
4. Expand marketing outreach in countries showing low engagement using filters.

This dashboard project demonstrates advanced Power BI skills including segmentation analysis, GoG growth tracking, and product-level revenue insights to support strategic retail decision-making.
